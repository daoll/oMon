Da Oll Moniroting project

Because internet users complain about networks lags,
Because people wants to find the guilty bandwidth eater,
Because there are so many devices connecting to an access point,
Because I prefer facts rather than assumptions,
Because I'm curious and an IT lover,

I am started this project to capture and know what's REALLY hapening on my private home network and provide facts to my favorite users :)
